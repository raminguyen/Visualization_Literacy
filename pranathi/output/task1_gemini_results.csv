51,Q161_img1.png,1,red,"To determine how much the price of a barrel of oil fell from April to September in 2015, we first need to identify the oil prices at these two points in time from the graph.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate April on the x-axis. Follow the red line up to find the corresponding price on the y-axis. The point for April is exactly at **$45**.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate September on the x-axis. Follow the red line up to the blue dot to find the corresponding price on the y-axis. The point for September is one grid line below $40, which means it is at **$39**.

3.  **Calculate the fall from April to September:**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $39 = $6.

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question might be implicitly referring to a significant drop highlighted in the graph within the broader period of April to September, specifically the ""Steep drop"" annotated on the graph.

Let's examine the ""Steep drop"" indicated on the graph. This drop occurs between June and July.
1.  **Price in June:** Locate June on the x-axis. The point for June is one grid line below $60, which means it is at **$59**.
2.  **Price in July:** Locate July on the x-axis. The point for July is two grid lines above $40, which means it is at **$42**.

3.  **Calculate the fall from June to July (the ""Steep drop""):**
    Fall = Price in June - Price in July
    Fall = $59 - $42 = $17.

This value ($17) is one of the options. Given that the period ""April to September"" includes the ""Steep drop"" highlighted in the graph, and $17 is an exact match to one of the options, it is the most plausible intended answer.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{17}}$."
52,Q161_img1.png,1,red,"1.  **Identify the price in April:** Looking at the graph, the price in April is exactly $45.

3.  **Calculate the direct fall:** The fall from April to September is $45 - $39 = $6.

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests either an error in the question's phrasing or the options, or that the question intends to ask about another prominent feature of the graph within that period.

Let's examine other significant drops within the period from April to September:
*   The graph explicitly labels a ""Steep drop"" between June and July.
*   **Price in June:** Approximately $58 (two minor ticks below $60).
*   **Price in July:** Approximately $43 (three minor ticks above $40).
*   **Fall from June to July:** $58 - $43 = $15.

The value $15 is one of the options. Given that the specific calculation for ""April to September"" ($6) is not an option, and $15 corresponds to the clearly labeled ""Steep drop"" which occurs within the broader period of April to September, it is highly probable that the question implicitly refers to this significant drop. In multiple-choice questions with potential ambiguities, the option that aligns with a prominent visual cue or a common interpretation of ""fall"" (like the steepest drop) is often the intended answer when the literal calculation is not available.

The fall from June to July is $58 - $43 = $15. This value ($15) is one of the options.

Given that the direct calculation for ""April to September"" ($6) is not an option, and there's a prominently labeled ""Steep drop"" on the graph which calculates to $15 (an exact option), it is highly probable that the question intends to refer to this specific steep drop, despite the slightly misaligned time frame stated in the question.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the red line (blue dot) up to find the corresponding price on the y-axis. The y-axis has major grid lines every $5, with 5 smaller divisions between them, meaning each small division represents $1. The blue dot at September is 4 divisions above $35, indicating a price of $35 + $4 = $39.

    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $39 = $6

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question might be asking for something other than the direct net change, or there might be an implicit reference to a prominent feature on the graph.

This value ($15) is one of the options. Although the question asks about the fall ""from April to September,"" and there's a rise from April to May before a fall, it is common in graph interpretation questions that if the direct calculation is not an option, one should look for the most significant or explicitly labeled feature within the given period that matches an option. The $15 drop from June to July is a ""Steep drop"" within the April-September period and perfectly matches an option.

Another fall within the period is from July ($43) to September ($39$), which is $43 - $39 = $4. This is also an option.

Given that the drop from June to July is explicitly labeled as a ""Steep drop"" and calculates to exactly $15, this is the most likely intended answer, representing a significant fall occurring within the April-September timeframe.

57,Q161_img10.png,1,tomato,"To determine the approximate fall in the price of a barrel of oil from April to September in 2015, we need to read the prices from the graph for these months.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate 'Apr' on the x-axis and find the corresponding price on the y-axis. The orange line is exactly at $45 for April.
    Price in April = $45.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate 'Sep' on the x-axis and find the corresponding price on the y-axis (indicated by the blue dot). The blue dot is between $35 and $40, appearing to be approximately $39.
    Price in September = $39 (approx).

3.  **Calculate the fall (literal interpretation):**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $39 = $6.
    If we consider $6, the closest option is $4 (difference $2). However, options $15 and $17 are significantly larger, which suggests another interpretation might be intended.

Let's consider an alternative interpretation, which often happens with such questions: the question might refer to the fall from the peak of the ""Oil Prices Spike Between April and June"" to September, as this represents the significant drop. The ""Steep drop"" annotation also points to this decline.

*   **Peak Price:** The peak price occurs in May, at $60. The price in June is slightly lower, around $58.
*   **Price in September:** Still approximately $39.

Let's calculate the fall from the June point (which marks the start of the ""Steep drop""):
Price in June = $58 (approx)
Price in September = $39 (approx)
Fall = $58 - $39 = $19.

Now, let's compare this calculated fall of $19 with the given options:
*   $4: Not close to $19.
*   $15: Difference is $|19 - 15| = 4$.
*   $17: Difference is $|19 - 17| = 2$.
*   $45: Too high, this is a price, not a fall.

Comparing the differences, $17 is the closest option to $19. This interpretation seems more aligned with the options provided, as $6 is not among the options and $4 is much smaller. The question title and the ""Steep drop"" annotation point to the significance of the decline from the post-spike period.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate September on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the data point (blue circle). The price is below the 40 USD line but above the 35 USD line. Estimating its position, it appears to be approximately 39 USD. So, Price(September) ≈ 39 USD.

3.  **Net Fall (April to September):** The net change in price from April to September is 45 - 39 = 6 USD. However, 6 USD is not among the given options.

*   **Price in June:** Approximately $58.
*   **Price in July:** Approximately $43.
*   **Drop from June to July:** $58 - $43 = $15.

This value ($15) is one of the options. The period ""April to September"" includes the months of June and July. It is common in graph interpretation questions for an explicitly highlighted feature (like ""Steep drop"") to be the intended answer, even if the question's phrasing might seem to suggest a different calculation (like a net change over the entire period). Given that $7 is not an option and $15 is, it is highly probable that the question implicitly refers to the most significant drop highlighted within that timeframe.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{15}}$"
64,Q161_img2.png,3,navy,"To determine the price fall, we need to identify the oil prices at April and September from the graph.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""April"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the data point for April. Reading across to the y-axis (Price (USD)), the price is exactly $45.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""September"" on the x-axis. Follow the line (indicated by the blue dot) up to the data point for September. The y-axis has major grid lines at intervals of $5 ($20, $25, $30, $35, $40, $45, $50, $55, $60). There are 5 smaller divisions between each $5 interval, meaning each small division represents $1. The blue dot for September is on the horizontal line that is two small divisions below the $40 line. Therefore, the price in September is $40 - $2 = $38.

3.  **Calculate the fall (direct interpretation):**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $38 = $7.
    However, $7 is not an option.

Let's reconsider the question's intent, given the options. The graph shows a ""Steep drop"" from June/July onwards. Let's examine the drops within the period from April to September:

*   **April to May:** Price increased from $45 to $60 (a rise, not a fall).
*   **May to June:** Price fell from $60 to $58. Fall = $2.
*   **June to July:** Price fell from $58 to $43. Fall = $15.
*   **July to August:** Price fell from $43 to approximately $41. Fall = $2.
*   **August to September:** Price fell from approximately $41 to $38. Fall = $3.

The largest single-month drop within the ""April to September"" period is $15 (from June to July). This value matches one of the provided options. It is plausible that the question, despite the wording ""from April to September"", is asking for the magnitude of this significant ""steep drop"" that occurs within that timeframe.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{\$15}}$"
65,Q161_img2.png,4,navy,"To determine the fall in oil price from April to September 2015, we need to read the price at each of these months from the graph.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis. The data point for April is exactly at $45 on the y-axis. So, Price(April) = $45.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. There is a blue dot indicating the price for September. Reading its value on the y-axis, we can see that the September price is on the second tick mark below $40. Since each tick mark represents $1 (e.g., from $35 to $40 there are 5 ticks for $5), the September price is $40 - $2 = $38. So, Price(September) = $38.

3.  **Net Fall from April to September:** Calculate the difference: $45 - $38 = $7.

Now, let's compare this calculated value ($7) with the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
Our calculated value of $7 is not among the options.

Let's consider if the question refers to another prominent ""fall"" indicated on the graph within the April to September period. The graph explicitly labels a ""Steep drop"" which occurs between June and July. Let's calculate the value of this steep drop:

1.  **Price in June:** The data point for June is slightly below $60. Estimating from the graph, it appears to be around $58.
2.  **Price in July:** The data point for July is clearly above $40. Estimating from the graph, it appears to be around $43.
3.  **Steep Drop (June to July):** Calculate the difference: $58 - $43 = $15.

This value ($15) is one of the options. Given that the direct net fall from April to September ($7) is not an option, and $15 corresponds to a significant and labeled ""steep drop"" that occurs *within* the period from April to September, it is highly probable that this is the intended answer to the question. The phrasing ""how much did the price... fall from April to September"" could be interpreted as identifying a significant fall that occurred during that period.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line upwards to the blue dot representing the price in September. This point is slightly below $40. Examining the scale, there are 5 subdivisions between $35 and $40, meaning each subdivision is $1. The point for September appears to be exactly at **$39.5**.

3.  **Calculate the fall:** The fall from April to September is the difference between the April price and the September price.
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $39.5 = $5.5

Now, let's compare this calculated value to the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
Our calculated fall of $5.5 is not among the options.

However, the graph also features a ""Steep drop"" annotation. Let's calculate the value of this drop to see if it matches any options. The ""Steep drop"" occurs from June to July.
-   Price in June: The point for June is just below $60, appearing to be around **$58**.
-   Price in July: The point for July is clearly below $45 and above $40, appearing to be around **$43**.
-   Steep drop (June to July) = Price in June - Price in July = $58 - $43 = **$15**.

Since $15 is one of the options and corresponds to a significant and annotated drop within the general timeframe of ""April to September"" (June and July are between April and September), it is highly probable that the question, despite its phrasing, is referring to this ""steep drop"". The direct calculation for the net change from April to September ($5.5) is not an option.

Also, the drop from July to September is $4, which is also an option.

Given that $15 is explicitly labeled as a ""Steep drop"" and matches an option, it is a strong candidate for the intended answer, even if the timeframe stated in the question is a bit broader or ambiguous in context of the graph's overall shape. The phrase ""fall from April to September"" might be interpreted as identifying *a* significant fall that occurred after April and before or at September.

Let's re-evaluate the question's intent, as ""About how much did the price... fall from April to September"" could refer to a significant fall that occurred within this period, rather than just the net change between the two specific points.

Looking at the graph, the oil prices spike between April and June, reaching a peak in May at $60. After this spike, there is a significant drop. Let's examine the drops:

*   **From May (peak) to September:** Price in May is $60. Price in September is $40. Fall = $60 - $40 = $20.
*   **From June to September:** Price in June appears to be $58 (two small units below $60, assuming each small grid line is $1). Price in September is $40. Fall = $58 - $40 = $18.

This $15 fall from June to July matches one of the options exactly. Given that the question asks ""About how much"" and $5 (the net fall) is not an option, it's plausible the question refers to the most significant drop that occurred within that overall period.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate September on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the blue dot, which represents the price. The price in September is approximately $39 (it's one minor grid line below $40, and each minor grid line represents $1).

3.  **Calculate the net fall:** If we calculate the direct fall from April to September, it is $45 - $39 = $6. However, $6 is not among the given options.

This suggests that the question is asking for a significant fall *within* the period from April to September, rather than the net change from the specific April point. The title indicates ""Oil Prices Spike Between April and June,"" followed by a ""Steep drop.""

Let's look at the significant drops that occur after the spike, within the April to September period:
*   The price peaks in May at $60.
*   From May to June, the price falls from $60 to $58 (a $2 fall).
*   From June to July, the price falls from $58 to $43 (a $15 fall). This is a very steep drop and $15 is one of the options.
*   From May (the peak) to July, the price falls from $60 to $43 (a $17 fall). This fall also occurs within the ""April to September"" window, and $17 is also an option.
*   From July to September, the price falls from $43 to $39 (a $4 fall). $4 is also an option, but this is a smaller fall later in the period.

We have two strong candidates: $15 (June to July) and $17 (May to July).
The phrase ""fall from April to September"" is broad. The spike begins after April, peaks in May. A significant fall from this spike occurs.
The fall from the absolute peak in May ($60) to July ($43) is $17. This represents the initial, substantial decline from the highest point in the graph within the relevant period.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate September on the x-axis. Follow the line down to the corresponding point (marked with a blue dot). This point aligns exactly with **$39** on the y-axis.

Now, calculate the fall:
Fall = Price in April - Price in September

Next, we compare this calculated value with the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45, Omit.
Our calculated value of $6 is not among the options.

Let's consider possible interpretations for why $6 is not an option:
*   **Rounding/Approximation:** If $6$ is approximated, $4$ is the closest numerical option, but it's $2 off, which is a significant difference for a $6 value (33%).
*   **Alternative Interpretation (Steep Drop):** The graph has a title ""Oil Prices Spike Between April and June"" and an annotation ""Steep drop"" pointing to the decline after the peak. If the question implicitly refers to this ""steep drop"" within the April-September period, we should consider the fall from the peak to September.
    *   The peak price is in May, at **$60**.
    *   The price in June (end of spike) is approximately **$58**.
    *   The price in September is **$39**.

*   $15: $19 - $15 = $4$ difference; $21 - $15 = $6$ difference.
*   $17: $19 - $17 = $2$ difference; $21 - $17 = $4$ difference.

Comparing the differences, $17 is very close to $19 (only $2 difference). This suggests that the question might be implicitly asking for the ""steep drop"" from the end of the spike (June) to September. This is a common way questions are framed when the most direct calculation doesn't yield an option, but a prominent feature of the graph does.

Given that $6 is not an option, and $17 is a very close approximation for the ""steep drop"" of $19 (from June to September) or $21 (from May to September), $17 appears to be the intended answer.

80,Q161_img5.png,4,medium violet,"To determine how much the price of a barrel of oil fell from April to September in 2015, we need to estimate the price at these two months from the graph.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the corresponding point on the graph. This point appears to be approximately $45.5.
2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the blue dot. This point appears to be approximately $39.5.

Now, calculate the fall:
Fall = Price in April - Price in September
Fall = $45.5 - $39.5 = $6.0

Since $6.0 is not one of the given options, we look for the closest option:
Options: $4, $15, $17, $45, Omit.

Comparing $6.0 to the options:
*   $|6.0 - 4| = 2$
*   $|6.0 - 15| = 9$
*   $|6.0 - 17| = 11$

81,Q161_img5.png,5,medium violet,"To answer the question, we need to determine the price of oil in April and September 2015 from the graph and calculate the difference.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the corresponding point on the graph. This point is slightly above the $45 mark. Estimating its value, it appears to be approximately $45.5.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line down to the blue dot representing the price in September. This point is clearly below the $40 mark. Estimating its value, it appears to be approximately $39.5.

3.  **Calculate the fall:** The fall in price is the price in April minus the price in September.
    Fall = Price (April) - Price (September)
    Fall = $45.5 - $39.5 = $6.

Now, compare this calculated value to the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
Our calculated value of $6 is not among the options. This suggests that either our precise reading is off, or the question is indirectly asking for something else, or there is an error in the question/options.

Let's consider other prominent features of the graph that might match the options. The graph has an annotation ""Steep drop"" pointing to the segment between June and July. Let's calculate this drop:
*   Price in June: The peak is in May at $60. The price in June is slightly below $60, approximately $58.
*   Price in July: The price in July is approximately $43.
*   Drop from June to July = $58 - $43 = $15.

This value ($15) perfectly matches one of the options. While the question asks for the fall ""from April to September,"" which literally means the difference between the April and September prices, it's common in multiple-choice questions for an unstated interpretation (like ""the maximum monthly drop within the period"") or a key feature marked on the graph (like ""Steep drop"") to be the intended answer when the direct interpretation doesn't yield an option. The period from April to September includes the June-July drop. Since $15 is a precise match for the ""Steep drop"" highlighted on the graph, it is highly likely the intended answer.

82,Q161_img6.png,1,saddle brown,"To determine the price fall, we first identify the price of oil in April and September from the graph.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis. The corresponding point on the line graph is exactly at $45 on the y-axis. So, the price in April was $45.
2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. The corresponding blue dot on the line graph is on the grid line just below $40. Given that each small division on the y-axis represents $1 (there are 5 divisions between $35 and $40), the point is at $39. So, the price in September was $39.

3.  **Calculate the fall from April to September:**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $39 = $6

1.  **Price in April:** Locate April on the x-axis. The corresponding point on the graph is exactly at $45 on the y-axis. So, the price in April was $45.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate September on the x-axis. The blue dot marking the price for September is just below the $40 line. Visually, it appears to be approximately $39.

3.  **Calculate the fall (direct interpretation):** The fall from April to September would be the price in April minus the price in September.
    Fall = $45 (April) - $39 (September) = $6.

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question might be looking for a different interpretation or a different specific fall shown on the graph.

Let's look at the ""Steep drop"" annotation on the graph. This annotation points to the decline in price from June to July.
-   **Price in June:** The point for June is just below the $60 line, estimated to be $58.
-   **Price in July:** The point for July is just above the $40 line, estimated to be $43.

85,Q161_img6.png,4,saddle brown,"To determine the fall in oil price from April to September, we need to identify the price for each of these months from the graph.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the data point for April. The price is exactly on the $45 mark. So, Price(April) = $45.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the data point (blue circle) for September. The point is slightly below the $40 mark. Estimating its value, it appears to be around $39 or $39.5. Let's use $39.5 for now.

3.  **Net Fall from April to September:**
    Fall = Price(April) - Price(September)
    Fall = $45 - $39.5 = $5.5

This value ($5.5) is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question might be asking for a different interpretation of ""fall from April to September"", such as the largest continuous fall within that period, or the drop corresponding to the ""steep drop"" indicated on the graph.

Let's examine the ""steep drop"" portion of the graph, which occurs after the peak in May/June.
-   **Price in May:** The peak is exactly at $60.
-   **Price in June:** The point for June is slightly below $60, appearing to be around $58.
-   **Price in July:** The point for July is between $40 and $45, appearing to be around $43.
-   **Price in August:** The point for August is slightly above $40, appearing to be around $41.

Now let's calculate the fall for different segments within the April-September period that are part of the overall decline:
*   **Fall from June to July:** This segment is visibly the steepest part of the decline, and the ""Steep drop"" arrow points to it.
    Fall = Price(June) - Price(July) = $58 - $43 = $15.
    This value ($15) is one of the options.

*   **Fall from July to September:**
    Fall = Price(July) - Price(September) = $43 - $39.5 = $3.5 (approx. $4).
    This value ($4) is also an option.

*   **Fall from June to August:**
    Fall = Price(June) - Price(August) = $58 - $41 = $17.
    This value ($17) is also an option.

Given the ambiguity, the most reasonable interpretation is to find the most significant ""fall"" highlighted in the graph, or the most direct calculation that matches an option. The ""Steep drop"" annotation clearly indicates the sharp decline from June to July. The calculation for this segment results in $15, which is an exact match to an option. While $4 and $17 are also possible depending on the exact segment chosen, $15 represents the visually ""steepest"" and most prominent drop within the specified period (from April to September, encompassing the peak and subsequent fall).

5.  **Examine the ""Steep drop"" annotation:** The graph has an annotation ""Steep drop"" pointing to the segment between June and July.
    *   **Price in June:** The price in June is just below $60, approximately $58.

    *   **Fall during ""Steep drop"" (June to July):** $58 - $43 = $15.

6.  **Conclusion:** The calculated fall from April to September is $6. However, $6 is not among the options.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. There is a blue dot at this point. Reading its value on the y-axis, it appears to be approximately $39.

3.  **Calculate the literal fall:** The fall from April to September would be Price(April) - Price(September) = $45 - $39 = $6.

Now, let's examine the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
Our calculated fall of $6 is not among the options. This suggests either a slight misreading of the graph (though the points seem clear) or an alternative interpretation of the question.

Let's look for other ""falls"" within the ""April to September"" period that match the options:
*   The graph has an annotation ""Steep drop"" pointing to the segment between June and July.
    *   Price in June: Approximately $58.
    *   Price in July: Approximately $43.
    *   The ""Steep drop"" from June to July is $58 - $43 = $15. This value matches one of the options ($15).

    *   Price in September: Approximately $39.
    *   The fall from July to September is $43 - $39 = $4. This value also matches one of the options ($4).

We have two options that could be derived from significant drops within the April to September timeframe: $4 (July-Sep) and $15 (June-Jul, labeled ""Steep drop"").

The phrase ""About how much did the price of a barrel of oil fall from April to September"" is open to interpretation if the exact start-to-end difference is not an option. It could refer to:
a) The net fall from April to September ($6). Since this isn't an option, we look for the closest. $4 is closest to $6, but it's not a direct calculation from April.
b) The most prominent or significant fall *within* the period April to September. The ""Steep drop"" is explicitly labeled on the graph and its value ($15) is an exact option. This segment (June to July) clearly falls within the April to September period.

Given that $15 represents the ""Steep drop"" as explicitly indicated on the graph and is a direct calculation that matches an option, it is the most likely intended answer, even if the wording ""from April to September"" is broad. It asks ""About how much did the price... fall"", implying a significant fall. The ""Steep drop"" is the most significant fall depicted in the given range.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the corresponding blue dot. The y-axis has major grid lines every $5 (e.g., 35, 40) and minor grid lines every $1. The blue dot for September is exactly one minor grid line below $40. Therefore, the price in September is $39.

3.  **Calculate the fall from April to September:**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $39 = $6.

Now, let's compare this calculated value to the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
Our calculated value of $6 is not among the options. This suggests that the question might be interpreted differently, or the options are approximate.

Let's consider alternative interpretations, especially given the title ""Oil Prices Spike Between April and June"". The question might be asking about the fall from the peak of this spike *after* April to September.
*   **Peak Price (May):** The peak of the spike is in May, where the price reaches $60.
    Fall from May (peak) to September = $60 - $39 = $21. This is not an option.

*   **Price at end of spike period (June):** The spike is ""between April and June"". The price in June is exactly two minor grid lines below $60, which is $58.
    Fall from June to September = $58 - $39 = $19.

Now let's compare $19 and $21$ to the given options:
*   $4: Too small.
*   $15: Difference from $19 is $4. Difference from $21 is $6.
*   $17: Difference from $19 is $2. Difference from $21 is $4.
*   $45: This is a price, not a fall amount.

Comparing the differences, $17 is the closest option to $19 (which is the fall from June to September) and also to $21 (which is the fall from May peak to September). The fall of $19 is derived from precise readings of the graph for June and September. Among the choices, $17 is the best approximation.

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question is not asking for the net change between April and September, but rather a significant fall *within* that period. Let's look for other prominent drops within the timeframe from April to September:

*   **From May to July:** The price in May (the peak) is approximately $60. The price in July is approximately $43. The fall is $60 - $43 = $17. This is one of the options.
*   **From June to July:** The price in June is approximately $58. The price in July is approximately $43. The fall is $58 - $43 = $15. This is also one of the options and represents the steepest single-month drop.
*   **From July to September:** The price in July is approximately $43. The price in September is approximately $39. The fall is $43 - $39 = $4. This is labeled ""Steep drop"" on the graph and is also an option.

Since the direct net fall ($6) is not an option, and the question asks ""About how much did the price...fall"", it is likely referring to the most significant or prominent fall during that period.

Comparing the plausible drops:
*   $4 (July to September, explicitly labeled ""Steep drop"")
*   $15 (June to July, largest single-month fall)
*   $17 (May to July, largest fall from the peak within the specified period)

2.  **Price in September:** Locate September on the x-axis. The data point for September (marked with a blue dot) is approximately $39.

If we calculate the direct fall from April to September:
Fall = Price in April - Price in September = $45 - $39 = $6.

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question might be interpreted differently, or it refers to the fall from the peak of the spike that occurred ""Between April and June"", as indicated by the graph's title and the ""Steep drop"" label.

Let's consider the price at the peak of the spike and the price in June, which marks the end of the ""spike between April and June"" period before the ""steep drop"".

*   **Peak price (in May):** The price reaches its peak in May at $60.
*   **Price in June:** The price in June is slightly below the peak, approximately $57 to $58.

Now, let's calculate the fall from these higher points to September:

*   **Fall from the May peak to September:**
    Fall = Price in May - Price in September = $60 - $39 = $21.
*   **Fall from the June price to September:**
    Let's estimate June's price as $58.
    Fall = Price in June - Price in September = $58 - $39 = $19.
    (If June was $57, the fall would be $18. If June was $56, the fall would be $17.)

Comparing these calculated falls to the options:
*   For a fall of $21 (from May peak):
    $|21 - 17| = 4$

*   For a fall of $19 (from June's price):
    $|19 - 17| = 2$
    $|19 - 15| = 4$
    So, $17 is the closest option.

Given that the question asks ""About how much"" and provides options, it's highly probable that it refers to the decline from the higher price points reached after April and before the steep drop that leads to September. Both the fall from the May peak and the fall from the June price point to September yield a value closest to $17.

The net fall from April to September would be $45 - $39 = $6.

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question might be asking for a different interpretation of ""fall from April to September"", possibly referring to the ""Steep drop"" highlighted in the graph, which occurs within this period.

-   The ""Steep drop"" occurs between June and July.
-   **Price in June:** Locate ""Jun"" on the x-axis. The price is approximately $58.

The fall from May to July is $60 - $43 = $17.

Both $15 and $17 are options. Given the visual placement of the ""Steep drop"" label, it specifically points to the segment between June and July. Therefore, $15 seems to be the intended answer for the labeled ""steep drop"".

2.  **Price in September:**
    Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the blue data point for September. This point is between $35 and $40. Observing the grid lines, the major grid lines are at $5 intervals. The blue dot for September appears to be exactly on a minor grid line, which corresponds to $1 increments if the $5 interval is divided into five $1 segments. The point is one increment below $40, meaning it is at $39.
    So, the price in September = $39.

3.  **Calculate the fall:**

A) $4
B) $15
C) $17
D) $45
E) Omit

Our calculated value of $6 is not among the options. Let's examine if any of the options could be correct by re-evaluating our readings or considering common question patterns for potentially flawed questions:

*   If the fall was $4, the September price would be $45 - $4 = $41. Visually, the blue dot is clearly below $40, so $41 is incorrect.
*   If the fall was $15, the September price would be $45 - $15 = $30. Visually, the blue dot is clearly above $30, so $30 is incorrect.
*   If the fall was $17, the September price would be $45 - $17 = $28. Visually, the blue dot is clearly above $28, so $28 is incorrect.
*   $45 is the price in April, not the fall.

This suggests that the question, as phrased, does not have a precise answer among the options based on a direct reading of ""April to September"".

However, let's look for other significant drops that might be implied by the graph's annotations or common interpretations of such charts:
*   The graph title mentions a ""Spike Between April and June"". The peak price occurs in May (approx. $60) or June (approx. $58).
*   There's an annotation ""Steep drop"" pointing to the period after June. The steepest drop occurs from June to July.
    *   Price in June: Approximately $58.
    *   Price in July: Approximately $43.
    *   Drop from June to July = $58 - $43 = $15.
    This value ($15) is exactly one of the options. In multiple-choice questions where a direct calculation leads to an unlisted answer, but a related, prominent feature in the graph yields an exact option, that feature is often the intended answer. The ""steep drop"" is a prominent feature explicitly highlighted.

Considering this common interpretation for potentially ambiguous questions, the drop of $15 from June to July, which is explicitly labelled as a ""Steep drop"", is the most plausible intended answer, despite the question literally asking ""from April to September"".

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the data point for April. The price aligns with $45 on the y-axis. So, the price in April was approximately $45.

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the data point (marked by a blue circle) for September. This point is below $40 and above $35. It appears to be roughly at $39.5.

3.  **Calculate the fall:** The fall in price is the price in April minus the price in September.
    Fall = Price (April) - Price (September)
    Fall = $45 - $39.5 = $5.5

Now, let's compare this calculated fall with the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
Our calculated fall of $5.5 is closest to $4.

The final answer is $\boxed{4}$"
99,Q161_img9.png,3,light gray,"To determine the fall in oil price from April to September 2015, we need to read the approximate prices from the graph for these months.

1.  **Price in April:** Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the corresponding point on the graph. This point aligns exactly with **$45** on the y-axis (Price (USD)).

2.  **Price in September:** Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the blue dot for September. This dot is clearly between $35 and $40. It appears to be closer to $40, approximately **$39**.

3.  **Calculate the fall from April to September:**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $45 - $39 = $6.

Now, let's compare this calculated value ($6) with the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
Our calculated $6 is not an exact match for any option. However, it is closest to $4.

Let's consider other interpretations of ""fall from April to September"" given the options and the graph's features (like ""Steep drop"" label). The period ""April to September"" includes the peak price after April (in May/June) and subsequent declines.

*   **Fall from the peak (May) to September:**
    Price in May (peak) = Approximately $60.
    Price in September = Approximately $39.
    Fall = $60 - $39 = $21.
    Among the options, $17 is the closest to $21, but there's a difference of $4.

*   **Fall from June to September (start of the major decline):**
    Price in June = Approximately $58.
    Price in September = Approximately $39.
    Fall = $58 - $39 = $19.
    Among the options, $17 is the closest to $19, with a difference of $2. This is a plausible approximation.

*   **Fall from July to September (period labeled ""Steep drop""):**
    Price in July = Locate ""Jul"" on the x-axis. The point on the line is between $40 and $45, appearing to be around $43.
    Price in September = Approximately $39 (the blue dot).
    Fall = $43 - $39 = $4.
    This value ($4) is an exact match for one of the options.

Given that $4 is an exact match for a clear segment of the decline within the specified period (""April to September"") and corresponds to the visually labeled ""Steep drop"", it is the most likely intended answer, even if the phrasing ""from April"" is broad. The other common interpretations ($6, $19, $21) either do not match any option or require larger rounding/estimation discrepancies than the $4 option.

The final answer is $\boxed{$4}$"
100,Q161_img9.png,4,light gray,"The price of a barrel of oil in April is shown to be $45.
The price of a barrel of oil in September is marked by a blue dot. Visually, this dot is slightly below the $40 line, approximately at $39.

To calculate the fall in price from April to September:
Fall = Price in April - Price in September
Fall = $45 - $39
Fall = $6

Now, let's compare this calculated fall ($6) with the given options:
$4
$15
$17
$45

Among the given options, $4 is the numerically closest to our calculated value of $6. Although our estimate is $6, $4 is the most plausible choice when limited to these options.

The final answer is $\boxed{4}$"
101,Q161_img9.png,5,light gray,"The question asks about the fall in price from April to September 2015.

1.  **Identify the price in April:** Looking at the graph, the price in April is exactly $45.
2.  **Identify the price in September:** The blue dot for September is at $39.
3.  **Calculate the net fall from April to September:** $45 (April) - $39 (September) = $6.

However, $6 is not among the given options ($4, $15, $17, $45). This suggests that the question might be asking for a different interpretation of ""fall from April to September,"" possibly related to the ""Steep drop"" annotation.

Let's examine the ""Steep drop"" highlighted in the graph.
*   This drop occurs between June and July.
*   The price in June is $58.
*   The price in July is $43.
*   The drop from June to July is $58 - $43 = $15.

This value ($15) is one of the options. The period from June to July falls within the broader period of ""April to September"". Given that the direct calculation ($6) is not an option, and a significant drop explicitly labeled as ""Steep drop"" (which is $15) is an option and occurs within the specified timeframe, it is the most likely intended answer.

Let's also check other potential large drops within the period:
*   From the peak in May ($60) to July ($43): $60 - $43 = $17. This is also an option.

We have two plausible answers, $15 and $17.
The phrase ""Steep drop"" is an explicit annotation pointing to the segment from June to July. This visual cue strongly suggests that the question is directing us to the value of this specific drop, which is $15. While the drop from the absolute peak (May) to July ($17) is also significant, the ""Steep drop"" label directly points to the June-July interval, not May-July.

Therefore, the most direct interpretation of the visual hint points to the $15 fall.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{15}}$"
