1.  **Locate February:** Find ""Feb"" on the horizontal axis.
2.  **Trace up to the line:** Follow the vertical line from ""Feb"" upwards until it intersects with the data line.
3.  **Read the price:** From the intersection point, trace horizontally to the left to read the value on the ""Price (US$)"" axis.

Visually, the point for February is slightly above the $50 mark on the y-axis.
Let's evaluate the given options:
*   $57.36: This is too high; the Feb price is well below $55.
*   $47.82: This is too low; the Feb price is clearly above $50.
*   $50.24: This value is just slightly above $50, which matches the visual representation of the point for February.
*   $39.72: This is far too low.

Based on the graph, the price in February is just over $50. Among the given choices, $50.24 is the most accurate representation of a price slightly above $50.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{50.24}}$",8.32

1.  Find ""Feb"" on the Month axis.
2.  Move vertically up from ""Feb"" to the data point on the line graph.
3.  Move horizontally from that data point to the ""Price (US$)"" axis.

The data point for February is just slightly above the 50 mark on the Y-axis.

Let's evaluate the given options:
*   $57.36: This value is too high; it corresponds more to the peak in April/May/June.
*   $47.82: This value is too low; February's price is clearly above 50.
