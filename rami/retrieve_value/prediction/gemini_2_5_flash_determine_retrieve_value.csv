1.  **Locate February:** Find ""Feb"" on the horizontal axis.
2.  **Trace up to the line:** Follow the vertical line from ""Feb"" upwards until it intersects with the data line.
3.  **Read the price:** From the intersection point, trace horizontally to the left to read the value on the ""Price (US$)"" axis.

Visually, the point for February is slightly above the $50 mark on the y-axis.
Let's evaluate the given options:
*   $57.36: This is too high; the Feb price is well below $55.
*   $47.82: This is too low; the Feb price is clearly above $50.
*   $50.24: This value is just slightly above $50, which matches the visual representation of the point for February.
*   $39.72: This is far too low.

Based on the graph, the price in February is just over $50. Among the given choices, $50.24 is the most accurate representation of a price slightly above $50.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{50.24}}$",8.32
