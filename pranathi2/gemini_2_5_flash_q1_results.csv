Options: $4, $15, $17, $45, Omit",Make Comparisons,Make Comparison,$15,Gemini Flash,"To determine how much the price of a barrel of oil fell from April to September, we need to read the approximate prices from the graph for both months.

1.  **Price in April:**
    *   Locate ""Apr"" on the horizontal axis (Month).
    *   Follow the line up to the data point for April.
    *   Read the corresponding value on the vertical axis (Price (US$)).
    *   The point for April appears to be exactly on the line for **$60**.

2.  **Price in September:**
    *   Locate ""Sep"" on the horizontal axis (Month).
    *   Follow the line down to the data point for September.
    *   Read the corresponding value on the vertical axis.
    *   The point for September is above the $45 line but below the $50 line. It looks to be approximately one-fifth to one-fourth of the way from $45 to $50.
    *   If it's one-fifth of the way: $45 + (1/5) * ($50 - $45) = $45 + (1/5) * $5 = $45 + $1 = **$46**.
    *   If it's one-fourth of the way: $45 + (1/4) * ($50 - $45) = $45 + (1/4) * $5 = $45 + $1.25 = **$46.25**.

3.  **Calculate the fall in price:**
    *   Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    *   Using an estimate of $46 for September: $60 - $46 = $14
    *   Using an estimate of $46.25 for September: $60 - $46.25 = $13.75

Comparing these calculated values ($14 or $13.75) to the given options:
*   $4

Options: $4, $15, $17, $45, Omit",Make Comparisons,Make Comparison,$15,Gemini Flash,"To determine how much the price of a barrel of oil fell from April to September, we need to read the approximate prices from the graph for both months.

1.  **Price in April:**
    Locate ""Apr"" on the x-axis (Month). Follow the line up to the data point for April. This point is exactly aligned with the 60 US$ mark on the y-axis (Price (US$)).
    So, the price in April was approximately **$60**.

2.  **Price in September:**
    Locate ""Sep"" on the x-axis. Follow the line up to the data point for September. This point falls between the 40 and 45 US$ marks. Observing the grid lines, there appear to be 5 subdivisions between 40 and 45, meaning each subdivision represents $1. The September point looks to be at the third subdivision above 40.
    So, the price in September was approximately **$43**.

3.  **Calculate the fall in price:**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $60 - $43 = **$17**

1.  **Price in April:**
    Locate 'Apr' on the x-axis. Follow the vertical line up to the data point for April.
    Read the corresponding value on the y-axis (Price (US$)).
    The data point for April is exactly on the $60 line.
    So, the price in April = $60.

2.  **Price in September:**
    Locate 'Sep' on the x-axis. Follow the vertical line up to the data point for September.
    Read the corresponding value on the y-axis.
    The data point for September is clearly below the $45 line and above the $40 line.
    To estimate more precisely, visually divide the segment between $40 and $45 into smaller parts. The September point appears to be approximately one-third of the way down from $45, or two-thirds of the way up from $40.
    The interval from $40 to $45 is $5.
    If it's 1/3 down from $45: $45 - (1/3 * 5) = 45 - 1.67 = $43.33.
    If it's 2/3 up from $40: $40 + (2/3 * 5) = 40 + 3.33 = $43.33.
    So, the estimated price in September is approximately $43.33.

3.  **Calculate the fall:**
    Fall = Price in April - Price in September
    Fall = $60 - $43.33 = $16.67

4.  **Compare with options:**
    The calculated fall is $16.67.
    Let's check the given options: $4, $15, $17, $45.
    $16.67 is much closer to $17 (difference of $0.33) than to $15 (difference of $1.67).

Therefore, the price of a barrel of oil fell by approximately $17.
